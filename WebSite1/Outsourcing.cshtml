    <p>
        In business, outsourcing involves the contracting out of a business process to another party (compare business process outsourcing). 
        The concept "outsourcing" came from American Glossary 'outside resourcing' and it dates back to at least 1981. Which means to use outside 
        resources and experts for to develop, expanded and...an organization Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets 
        from one firm to another, but not always. Outsourcing is also the practice of handing over control of public services to for-profit corporations.
        <br /><br />
        Outsourcing can also be viewed as any assistance from an intermediary that is more capable of or familiar with certain practices than us.
        [who?] It is just a way of seeking for help.
        <br /><br />
        Outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting,[5] and sometimes includes offshoring (relocating a business function to another country).
         Financial savings from lower international labor rates can provide a major motivation for outsourcing or offshoring.

        <h3>Reasons for outsourcing:</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
        Companies primarily outsource to reduce certain costs — such as peripheral or "non-core" business expenses, high taxes, 
        high energy costs, excessive government regulation/mandates, production and/or labor costs. The incentive to outsource may 
        be greater for U.S. companies due to unusually high corporate taxes and mandated benefits, like social security, Medicare, and 
        safety protection (OSHA regulations).
        <br /><br />
        At the same time, it appears U.S. companies do not outsource to reduce executive or managerial 
        costs. For instance, executive pay in the United States in 2007 was more than 400 times more than average workers—a gap 20 times bigger 
        than it was in 1965. In 2011, twenty-six of the largest US corporations paid more to CEO's than they paid in federal taxes. Such statistics 
        imply that the reason companies outsource is not to avoid costs in general but to avoid specific types of costs.

        <h3>Digital outsourcing:</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
        One major reason for outsourcing is the lack of available resources locally. This is particularly true for IT outsourcing, 
        where the US has a lack of available resources. This knowledge gap can be felt more outside major cities.
        <br /><br />
        The digital workforce of countries like India and China are only paid a fraction of what would be minimum wage in the US. 
        On average, software engineers are getting paid between 250,000 to 1,500,000 rupees ($4,000 to $23,000) in India as opposed 
        to the $40,000-$100,000 in countries like US and Canada. However, unlike typical sweatshops and manufacturing plants, most of 
        the digital workforce in developing countries have the flexibility to choose their working hours and which companies to work for. 
        With many individuals telecommuting from home, the companies that require this type of work do not need to allocate additional funds 
        for setting up of office space, management salary, and employee benefits as these individuals are contracted workers.
        <br /><br />
        Another method of outsourcing is using a microwork service for repetitive tasks that would otherwise have to be performed by employees.
